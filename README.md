#### Quick Start

``` bash
# Install gulp globally
npm i -g gulp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run gulp by just typing
gulp
# This will create dist folder. Inside a folder you will find minified html and css files. 
# File server.js in a root folder starts server on localhost:3000. Once you run gulp, gulp will connect to server.js file and start the server.
# Gulp also comes with auto-reload.

# Once you are done testing make sure to delete dist folder by running
gulp clean
```
